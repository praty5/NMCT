Algorithm: Bisection Method

Input from User:
- Interval boundaries a and b

Output:
- Iterations Completed
- Root x
- Corresponding function value f(x)

1. Start

2. Initialize variables:
   - Set n = 1 (iteration counter)
   - Set f = 1 
   - Stopping criteria/tolerance stop 
   - Define the function as f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 
   
3. Read input values for a and b

4. Calculate the new root x as (a + b) / 2
 a. Evaluate the function at the new x
 b. If f(x) is greater than 0, update b = x
 c. Else if f(x) is less than 0, update a = x
 
5. Increment the iteration counter n by 1

6. while f(x) is less than stop(tolerance) goto (3) otherwise proceed next.

7. Output final iteration number, x and f(x).

8. Stop
